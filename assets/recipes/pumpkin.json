On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle. Make sure to turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch deep dish pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang of crust and discard. Crimp the edges with a fork or flute the edges with your fingers, if desired. Brush edges lightly with egg wash mixture. Line the pie crust with parchment paper. Crunching up the parchment paper is helpful so that you can easily shape it into the crust. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. (Note that you will need at least 2 standard sets of pie weights to fit.) Make sure the weights/beans are evenly distributed around the pie dish. Par-bake the crust for 10 minutes.

A small part of the center will be wobbly &#8211; that&#8217;s ok. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown.

I can\u2019t say enough how stinking amazing this pie is. Even absolutely raw, I could not stop licking up the filling. It really is mind glowingly good. After reading the reviews and knowing that there was going to be lots left over (but not enough for a whole other pie) I decided to double the recipe and make three pie (Pumpkin pie freezes so beautifully; not that there\u2019s much of a chance of it making it to the freezer in my family, lol) But it made three )very generously filled) standard size 9\u201d pies.
