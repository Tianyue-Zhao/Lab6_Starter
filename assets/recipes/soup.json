(It doubled beautifully.) Truly a comfort food type of recipe, evoking memories of a time when 3 generations of us ended up living together (in a way-too-small family home) after the death of our Mother. We may have been sad sometimes but did we ever eat well, and enjoy sitting down--all 8 of us--at the old oak table.  Thanks for this particular recipe, Ladies!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mis"},"reviewBody":"One of the best soups I’ve ever made or tried. Creamy, earthy and delicious. I can’t wait to make some more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"TanyaS"},"reviewBody":"I made this soup tonight, it was actually the second time! My husband and I love this soup so much, we are big mushroom fans! Tonight I used 1lb of cremini and 1/2 lb Shitaki, so delicious!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karen H Miller"},"reviewBody":"AMAZING recipe!!  We came into a bagful of fresh oyster mushrooms and found your recipe. O...M...G!  Thank you! My husband can't tolerate onions so I substituted onion powder and as I was out of white wine, I subbed some cooking sherry.  Can't imagine a better soup, especially with a crusty baguette. We've printed the recipe and put it in the book!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bradley Rehwaldt"},"reviewBody":"Wonderful recipe, have made a couple of times. Omitted the flour and sourcream because of carb and fat content. Made with ingredients from sweet potato, carrot, mushroom soup and seasonings from this recipe, which I like the taste better. Added 1 cup white wine, 1 box chicken broth low sodium, 1 can coconut milk, 1 pkg onion soup mix, and 1 tbsp worchestutire? Sauce, 1 small can sliced mushrooms for flavor. Husband liked the flavors and broth. Would like it thicker, but he likes more broth:) A keeper for winters cold days, very delicious","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dana T Salvatore"},"reviewBody":"This recipe is definitely a great base. However; I always find that I need WAY more soy sauce than what's in this recipe. Additionally, I like to caramelize one large onion ahead of time and mix them into the soup at the end. You cannot caramelize the onions the normal way due to the liquid that comes out of the mushrooms. I also add cayenne pepper to give it a wonderful kick at the end! Trust me on this! It turns out perfect, especially if you add a little more acid at the end with a splash of balsamic and a splash of worcestershire to bring it all together.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vern"},"reviewBody":"I made this with foraged oyster mushrooms and chanterelles.
