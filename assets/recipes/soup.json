What started out as a little food diary on Instagram developed into a love affair creating full flavoured recipes in the kitchen. After surviving cancer, (Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma) and a lot of life's battles, including molestation, rape and abuse, I am eternally grateful to have been given a second chance. Although my life is far from perfect, I'm loving every moment.
