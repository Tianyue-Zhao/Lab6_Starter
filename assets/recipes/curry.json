I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I just used what I had. Only thing I left out was the chicken broth since I had already cooked the rice. I left out the curry leaves which I didn't have. I cheated a bit and used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and used ground ginger instead of fresh. I topped the rice with yogurt and cilantro. Can't wait to try this using the broth.","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-12-13","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Dodo"},"reviewBody":"Came out great!","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}}],"recipeCategory":["low sugar","vegetarian","weeknight meals","rice","side dish"],"recipeYield":"8 servings","description":"For lovers of curry flavors, this curried rice will hit the spot: garlicky, buttery, well-spiced but not too spicy.
